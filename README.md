The main aim our project is to develop laser fencing and to detectthe animal entries in agricultural field that prevent from damagingthe crops.• To save water and reduce human intervention in the agriculturefield by using soil moisture sensor.• To maintain certain temperature according to crop to get betteryield of crops.• To provide real-time monitoring, analysis, and control of agriculturalfield by using sensors and actuators .
Arduino IDE
• The Arduino IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is a software platform used for programming Arduino microcontrollers.
• It provides a simple and user-friendly interface for writing, compiling, and uploading code to Arduino boards.
• The IDE supports the Arduino programming languages to control various electronic devices and projects. Arduino IDE
Thingspeak cloud
• ThingSpeak is an Internet of Things (IoT) platform that allows to collect, analyze, and visualize data from sensors or devices.
• It provides a cloud-based infrastructure where you can store and retrieve data, as well as create applications and visualizations based on that data.
• ThingSpeak is often used in conjunction with IoT devices, such as sensors or microcontrollers, to monitor and control various physical phenomena.
IFTTT
•IFTTT (If This Then That) is a web-based service that allows you to create simple conditional statements, known as applets.
• These applets are built on the principle of "if this happens, then do that." Each applet consists of a trigger (the "if this" part) and an action (the "then do that" part)..“]•
IFTTT supports a wide range of apps, services, and devices, enabling you to automate tasks and integrate various online platforms and smart devices.
