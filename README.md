The main aim our project is to develop laser fencing and to detectthe animal entries in agricultural field that prevent from damagingthe crops.• To save water and reduce human intervention in the agriculturefield by using soil moisture sensor.• To maintain certain temperature according to crop to get betteryield of crops.• To provide real-time monitoring, analysis, and control of agriculturalfield by using sensors and actuators .
Hardware componentsArduino Uno
• Arduino Uno is a microcontroller board based on the atmega328p
• It has 14 digital input and output pins
• The board can be powered through the USB connection or Arduino Unoexternal power source
DHT-11 • DHT 11 sensor is a digital temperature and humidity sensor that uses a simple one-wire interface for communication.
• It measures temperatures from -40°C to 80°C and relative humidity levels from 0% to 100%.
• DHT11 sensor has a low power consumption, making it suitable DHT-11for battery-powered applications.
It also has a fast response time and is easy to integrate into various microcontroller platforms.
Soil moisture sensor
• Soil moisture sensors are devices that are used in the field to understand the volumetric moisture content in the soil in real time. 
• Soil moisture sensors measure or estimate the amount of water in the soil.
• Soil moisture sensors are often connected to IoT platforms, allowing realtime monitoring and data analysis.Soil moisture sensor
LDR • 
Light-dependent resistors (LDRs), are used to monitor light levels.
• LDR sensor data can be integrated into larger IoT platforms for comprehensive monitoring.
• Farmers can remotely access light intensity data, analyze trends, and make informed decisions about crop management.• 
LDRs can help identify shaded areas within a field.LDRRelay
• Relay is an electronic device that acts as a switch to control multiple electrical circuits or devices.
• By integrating Relay into a smart agriculture system, farmers can automate the control of multiple electrical devices based on specific conditions, sensor readings, or preprogrammed schedules. 
RelayMotor pump
• Motor commonly used in agriculture for irrigation.
• They deliver water directly to crops,ensuring efficient water distribution for optimal growth.
• The pump is lowered into the water source until it is fully submerged and Promoting energy efficiency and precise water managementMotor pumpSoftware componentsArduino IDE
• The Arduino IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is a software platform used for programming Arduino microcontrollers.
• It provides a simple and user-friendly interface for writing, compiling, and uploading code to Arduino boards.
• The IDE supports the Arduino programming languages to control various electronic devices and projects. Arduino IDE
Thingspeak cloud• ThingSpeak is an Internet of Things (IoT) platform that allows to collect, analyze, and visualize data from sensors or devices.
• It provides a cloud-based infrastructure where you can store and retrieve data, as well as create applications and visualizations based on that data.
• ThingSpeak is often used in conjunction with IoT devices, such as sensors or microcontrollers, to monitor and control various physical phenomena.
IFTTT
•IFTTT (If This Then That) is a web-based service that allows you to create simple conditional statements, known as applets.
• These applets are built on the principle of "if this happens, then do that." Each applet consists of a trigger (the "if this" part) and an action (the "then do that" part)..“]•
IFTTT supports a wide range of apps, services, and devices, enabling you to automate tasks and integrate various online platforms and smart devices.
