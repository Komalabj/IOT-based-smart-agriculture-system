Hardware components
Arduino Uno
• Arduino Uno is a microcontroller board based on the atmega328p
• It has 14 digital input and output pins
• The board can be powered through the USB connection or Arduino Unoexternal power source
DHT-11 
• DHT 11 sensor is a digital temperature and humidity sensor that uses a simple one-wire interface for communication.
• It measures temperatures from -40°C to 80°C and relative humidity levels from 0% to 100%.
• DHT11 sensor has a low power consumption, making it suitable DHT-11for battery-powered applications.
  It also has a fast response time and is easy to integrate into various microcontroller platforms.
Soil moisture sensor
• Soil moisture sensors are devices that are used in the field to understand the volumetric moisture content in the soil in real time. 
• Soil moisture sensors measure or estimate the amount of water in the soil.
• Soil moisture sensors are often connected to IoT platforms, allowing realtime monitoring and data analysis.Soil moisture sensor
LDR 
• Light-dependent resistors (LDRs), are used to monitor light levels.
• LDR sensor data can be integrated into larger IoT platforms for comprehensive monitoring.
• Farmers can remotely access light intensity data, analyze trends, and make informed decisions about crop management.
• LDRs can help identify shaded areas within a field.LDR
Relay
• Relay is an electronic device that acts as a switch to control multiple electrical circuits or devices.
• By integrating Relay into a smart agriculture system, farmers can automate the control of multiple electrical devices based on specific conditions, sensor readings, or preprogrammed schedules. Relay
Motor pump
• Motor commonly used in agriculture for irrigation.
• They deliver water directly to crops,ensuring efficient water distribution for optimal growth.
• The pump is lowered into the water source until it is fully submerged and Promoting energy efficiency and precise water managementMotor pumpSoftware components
